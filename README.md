### Hi there 👋 I'm MoeBuTa:) 


A graduate from The University of Western Australia with a Master's degree in Software Engineering.

Python, C, and Java are my primary programming languages for coursework and projects.

Also, a weeb, a fingerstyle guitar enthusiast, and a big fan of video games.

Having an idea, working hard to realise it, and enjoying the feeling of happiness.
