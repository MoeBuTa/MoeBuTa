### Hi there 👋 I'm MoeBuTa:) 


I'm a student studying Master's degree of Software Engineering at The University of Western Australia. I like software programming and ACG related stuff (you can tell it by googling the meaning of my id). I'm aiming to become a "tech otaku".

Here are some of the projects I've completed:

🔐 [MTDSimTime](https://github.com/MoeBuTa/MTDSimTime) - A research project on the simulation and evaluation of multiple moving target defence in the time domain.

🏥 [PubMedConnections](https://github.com/PubMedConnections/PubMedConnections) - A tool for exploring the relationships between authors in the PubMed database. 

🛤️ [SlimeMould](https://github.com/MoeBuTa/SlimeMould) - A Python-based model simulating the behaviour of the slime mould using the geometric data of Nanjing subway system.

♟️ [ChineseChessTutorial](https://github.com/MoeBuTa/ChineseChessTutorial) - CITS3004 Agile Web Development project using Flask, Jinja, and Sqlite.

🔢 [ComputationalAnalysis](https://github.com/MoeBuTa/ComputationalAnalysis) - CITS4009 Computational Analysis data visualisation project written in R.

🖥️ [MachineLearning](https://github.com/MoeBuTa/MachineLearning) - CITS5508 Machine Learning Lab assignments.

☁️ [CloudComputing](https://github.com/MoeBuTa/CloudComputing) - CITS5503 Cloud Computing Lab assignments.
