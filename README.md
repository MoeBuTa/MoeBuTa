### Hi there 👋 I'm MoeBuTa:) 


I am a graduate with a Master's degree in Software Engineering from The University of Western Australia. I like software programming and ACG-related stuff (you can tell by googling the meaning of my id). I'm aiming to become a "tech otaku".

Here are some of the projects I've completed:

♟️ [ChineseChessTutorial](https://github.com/MoeBuTa/ChineseChessTutorial) - CITS3004 Agile Web Development project using Flask, Jinja, and Sqlite.

🔢 [ComputationalAnalysis](https://github.com/MoeBuTa/ComputationalAnalysis) - CITS4009 Computational Analysis data visualisation project written in R.

🖥️ [MachineLearning](https://github.com/MoeBuTa/MachineLearning) - CITS5508 Machine Learning lab assignments.

☁️ [CloudComputing](https://github.com/MoeBuTa/CloudComputing) - AWS certification exam notes and CITS5503 Cloud Computing lab assignments.
